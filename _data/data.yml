    title: WHOAMI
    summary: |
        I am Ryota Kawakami. I am currently study information science in Osaka University, one of Japanese National University. I'm interested in information security. I want to prevent information from being stolen. As a result of keeping on thinking about doing it, I found my dream is to become a government staff who engage in national cybersecurity defense. To become excellent staff I must know more knowledge and techniques about cybersecurity. So I want to continue to join various event and acquiring knowledge and techniques.

        And I'm interested in the situation of not only Japan and also the world. I think that the best way to know about the world is to go abroad actually and talk with foreign people. When I joined Global Cybersecurity Camp 2018 in Seoul, I noticed that it is so important. I want to contribute to solving the problems of the world as a Japanese government staff. To do so, I need to know acutually current situations in the world.

        I'm cirious boy, so I'm interested in everything around me. I think that curiosity is a chain-like one. When I know something of my interest, then I have questions about it. And I try to know the answers. This means chain-like.

#    title: What is BountyCon for me?
#    summary: |
#      I think BountyCon is one of the beiggest event which many people all over the world join. and I think BountyCon is one of the biggest event which gives me more knowledge and techniques about computer security including bug bounty. I have been interested in computer security since March 2018, so maybe I have a little more knowledge than beginners. But last year I did my best to study cybersecurity through Security Camp, Global Cybersecuriy Camp and so on. As a result of these, I found it is important to know latest information at big events lile BountyCon. But because I'm student, I don't have enough money to take part in them. If I can join BountyCon, I will be able to learn many things. After it, I will be able to tell people around me like friends, colleagues and family my new knowledge. As a result, I believe it will lead to an improvement of security literacy in the world.

#      If I can join BountyCon, I will be able to tell other participants my opinion. Though others may think I am a beginner, my opinion is original to me. So my opinion is different from others'. This means my opinion has as same value as others' do. So, I intend to speak positively my opinion. I believe this action will be meaningful for all participants.
