    summary: |
        I am Ryota Kawakami. I am currently study information science in Osaka University, one of Japanese National University. I'm interested in information security. I want to prevent information from being stolen. As a result of keeping on thinking about doing it, I found my dream is to become a government staff who engage in national cybersecurity defense. To become excellent staff I must know more knowledge and techniques about cybersecurity. So I want to continue to join various event and acquiring knowledge and techniques.

        And I'm interested in the situation of not only Japan and also the world. I think that the best way to know about the world is to go abroad actually and talk with foreign people. When I joined Global Cybersecurity Camp 2018 in Seoul, I noticed that it is so important. I want to contribute to solving the problems of the world as a Japanese government staff. To do so, I need to know acutually current situations in the world.
